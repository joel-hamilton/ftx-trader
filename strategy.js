/**
STRATEGY

1st order a market order
2nd order
    - stop a tiny bit below the buy (if it's not pumping, don't bother) 
    - trailing stop 1%

Long-term: 
    - get order book and figure out how much I can buy without moving market too much. Some of these coins only trade single-digit millions in 24h
        - not a big deal on the buy, as limit means it will get only partially filled, but on the sell it could get ugly
    - size position and stop according to 24h volatility
        - probably too slow to calculate this on the fly, would have to have a recurring task, storage solution
    - size position according to reliability of signal
        - based on twitter account, market size (need to get more data/a feel for this)
        - based on sentiment ('BUYING $OXY!!!' should rank higher than 'decent chart setup for OXY', and 'OXY isn't nearly as good as some others' shouldn't coun't at all)

        High conviction bets:
        KALEO + small markets + 'send'

Thought: Even if a tweet doesn't move the market per se, it's likely to be excited about the right things at approximately the right times...
