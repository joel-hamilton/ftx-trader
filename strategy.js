STRATEGY

- get order book and figure out how much I can buy without moving market too much. Some of these coins only trade single-digit millions in 24h
    - not a big deal on the buy, as limit means it will get only partially filled, but on the sell it could get ugly
- size position and stop according to 24h volatility
    - probably too slow to calculate this on the fly, would have to have a recurring task, storage solution
- size position according to reliability of signal
    - based on twitter account, market size (need to get more data/a feel for this)

    High conviction bets:
    KALEO + small markets + 'send'

Thought: Even if a tweet doesn't move the market per se, it's likely to be excited about the right things at approximately the right times...

TODO
- when updating tweets, only add tweets older than an hour, so we have complete +-60 min data for it
- make 0th min round up (so after the tweet). Perhaps round up +1 interval if in last 10 seconds of period (so the range of buys would be 10s-25s after)?
- use OHLC to estimate P/L
- on update, save most recent account info, etc to database?
- save marketslist to DB
- make package.json scripts for updating tweet data, etc.
- "if the tik tokers can send literal dog sh*t, we can send $zec" caught the phrase send lit, but not send $zec

STRATEGY INVERSION
start with amt to risk (based on scale)
    - let riskAmt = 100
get ask
    - let bid = ask + 0.0001
calculate recent volatility (eg: last hour, in 1 min intervals)
    - let mean = (float) mean of the 60 intervals
    - let sqDeviations = ([floats]) square(mean - deviation)
    - let variance = (float) sum(sqDeviations) / 60
    - let periodVol = sqrt(variance)  IE: assuming std distribution, 2/3 of returns in 1 period will fall +/- periodVol/2
    - let 5periodVol = sqrt(5) * periodVol
set % trailing stop based on volatility
    - let trlStop = periodVol / 2 (or something like that)
quantity = bid * riskAmt / trlStop

THINGS TO ACTUALLY BUY
$RUNE, $ALPHA - RookieXBT
Other than $RUNE which is by far my biggest holding (I buy more everyday regardless of price) ‚Äî I‚Äôve been holding onto a sizeable amount of $ALPHA for some time And with that being said, I‚Äôve never felt more comfy than I do now. This summer is gonna be good.
